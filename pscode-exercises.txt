// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Perform operation: (number A) + (number B)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If number%2=0, print: "even"
If number%2>0, print: "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) get 5 integers: intA, intB, intC, intD, intE
b) perform operation: (intA+intB+intC+intD+intE) / 5 = X
c) 

if intA<intB, print intA
  else print intB
if (answer from previous) < intC, print (answer from previous)
  else print intC
continue for all 5 integers
answer at end = "minimum" 

if intA>intB, print intA
  else print intB
if (answer from previous) < intC, print (answer from previous)
  else print intC
continue for all 5 integers
answer at end = "maximum"

d) 
X = (value) = average of the 5 numbers
minimum = (value) = smallest of the 5 numbers
maximum = (value) = largest of the 5 numbers
